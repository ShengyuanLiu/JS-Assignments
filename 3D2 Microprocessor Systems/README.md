# Assignment 1
10/10, included C solution. XOR should have been using in C solution to turn off bits, used OR instead to specify bits to be masked and turned on.

# Assignment 2
10/10

# Assignment 3
10/10

# Assigment 4
7/10, not enough time to finish. Should have a stack for each thread of size 1K where R1-R15 (including PC, SP and CPSR) should all be stored with their context. The scheduler should switch between the two so that each subroutine can be branched to without timing inside the subroutines, ie the subroutines can be written independently without the programmer knowing about threading or timings. Didn't finish that. LOL.
