# Assignment 1
10/10

# Assignment 2
10/10 but should have a pointer to pointers (ie worker pointers should exist within a super factory pointer so that ids can be allocated too) within the structs

# Assignment 3
10/10, just assertions for conditions

# Assigment 4
10/10, but I kill a philosopher in the case of deadlock and assert never conditions using an external .live file. Could be better implemented, ie the actually atomic option is bad. Run assignment 4 using this:

```
$ spin -a -DN=5 -N deadlock_resolution.live lab4.pml
$ gcc pan.c -o pan
$ ./pan
```
